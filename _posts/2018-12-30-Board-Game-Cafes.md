# Cafes

This year, we were lucky enough to have the chance to visit so many new board game cafes, seven new cafes on three different continents.

Angela Reviews
[angela is critical. but all cafes get the highest rating possible, +++, because having these great places where we can play and try games and meet other people is the best and most important thing]

Disclaimer: We haven't been enough times, this is simply a one shot impression.

Knight Moves-

Uncommons-

Draughts-

Randolph Pub Ludique-

Victory Point-

Caffeinated Dragon Games-

Counter Culture-

Bastard Cafe-

+++, Mox Boardinghouse (num times visited: 2)- excellent selection of food and amazing amount of space. For a board game place, too much space goes towards MtG perhaps. I don't get how the restaurant works- they don't seem to try to turnover tables, so if you and your buddies rolled up with Rising Sun (true story), you could just sit there the entire time? Board game selection was alright but not amazing. I thought given the diversity of games they sold, they would have greater amounts available for demo. Tempted to purchase Fields of Arle.

+++, Meisia (1)- board game selection was good and quite large but awkward to access- the section downstairs was hard to see. They say you should contact them ahead and they will pull games for you, but not sure if they keep their online list of games updated. Selection of board games for sale was small but diverse. Food- interesting but not that good, also quite messy to eat. Their asian bun themed burgers- the bun needs to be toasted or it gets way too soggy. Lychee juice is too sweet. The Meisia Quadropolis tiles- loved!

+++, Marche (1)- Small board game selection but had a few new ones that I enjoyed. Food was pretty good and quite fun, mostly asian themed, also had some milk bubble tea smoothie type drinks. The rice bowl- egg is great, the pork is too salty. Seating wasn't super efficient. It's like half a karaoke bar, so if you sit at the one table in the back it's a bit loud.

+++, Queen of Spades (1)- beautiful place. Really gorgeous. Food was perfectly Melbourne (avocado toast anyone?), excellent coffee and spritzers. Horrible bathroom, which involved going outside. Board game selection was small and not great. I don't think we could have played any very long games if we didn't decide to play Twilight Struggle again.

+++, Game Parlour (2)- great selection of games! Nice organization as well, enforced by asking people to return games to the center table. A lot of kickstarter games, super fun and unique. Seating, even for 2, has enough space for a pretty large game. Seats by the window get VERY warm when the sun shines in though. Food- they had some spin on waffle sandwiches- the waffles were pretty tasteless and got soggy way too quickly. Salad was decent, same with the mohiko chicken bits. Waffle fries were way too oily. Soda seemed too expensive. Loved the dice towers!
