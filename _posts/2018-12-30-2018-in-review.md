2018 was a great year for board games.
We didn't get quite as many games in as last year (Robbie's statistics: 310 plays of 124 games, 93 new games. Last year: 343 plays of 134 games, 100 new games), but I feel we really explored a lot and were able to focus on some of our favorites.

## Quick Review

Angela and I tried many new games in 2018, as well as diving deeper into some old ones.
Our top two games played for the year were **Spirit Island**, with 66 plays, and **Gloomhaven**, with 23, both of which we started last year, but we really played a lot this year.

We both went to PAX East in April, and I went to PAX West in September, and we missed out on Pax Unplugged.
We also went to 7 new board game cafes this year:
Randolph Pub Ludique in Montreal, Canada; Mox Boardinghouse in Seattle, WA and Bellevue, WA; Meisia in Paris, France; March√© in Melbourne, Australia; Queen of Spades in Melbourne, Australia; Board Game Republic in Denver, CO; and The Game Parlor in San Francisco, CA.
Of course, we also made many trips to Victory Point Cafe, our favorite.

## Favorite Games of the Year

The game we played the most this year, and my personal favorite game, was **Spirit Island**.
Angela was especially happy that we finally had a game that we were able to really explore deeply.
Together, we played it 66 times this year, although some of those were me playing solo (Angela was "working").
It's complex enough to be interesting, and the setup of the game has enough variation that it always feels replayable.

We were also lucky enough to find a group of friends who enjoyed the game as much as we did, so we were able to play a four player game almost every week for some portions of the year.
I think that's another place the game really shines: it works well at all player counts.
The feeling of the game is very different with one or two people compared to four, but both are fun in their own way.

Angela: Robbie made his first laser cut organizer for <b>Spirit Island</b>- I hope this means all of our board games will eventually be similarly organized...

Another game I really enjoyed this year, although almost entirely at the other end of the spectrum, was **Azul**.
The rules are so simple, but still provide tons of depth.


<div class="content angela">
Angela: This year I liked (other than <b>Spirit Island</b>...) <b>Gloomhaven</b>, <b>Terraforming Mars</b>, <b>Trickerion</b>, and <b>Altiplano</b>. Also would shout out tile laying games like <b>Cottage Garden</b>, <b>Barenpark</b>, <b>Indian Summer</b>, <b>Azul</b>, <b>Carcassone</b> ... I don't know why I like these so much, but I do.

## Less Played Games
Some games that we played only one or two times this year that we want to try again:
- **Rajas of the Ganges**:
    This game was awesome.
    I liked the usage of dice.
    Similar to **Castles of Burgundy**, the dice influence what you can do, but don't decide everything.
    I thought the scoring track was really novel.
    (You get points in two separate areas. One track goes around the board clockwise, and the other goes counter-clockwise. The game ends when the two scores cross, and that person is the winner.)
    It really allows you to focus on different areas each game.
    I also thought the game was beautiful and the dice had great colors.
- **Grand Austria Hotel**:
    I really enojyed the central mechanic here of dice drafting.
    Again, it offered a good balance of encouraging certain actions but allowing you to choose what the action you really want to do.
- **Yokohama**:
    I felt the movement puzzle was something I was still struggling with by the end of the game.
    How do you optimize the actions you want to do while blocking the other players?
- **Wendake**:
    This game was fun, but there were so many different things to do that I definitely need to try this one a few more times to figure out the other strategies.
    I liked how the score tracks worked.
    There are four tracks, where you move up each in a differnet way.
    At the beginning of the game, they're paired randomly, and your score in each pair is the lower of the two.
- **Through the Ages**:
    We only played this one once.
    Again, there are so many different options that I feel like I have to play more before passing any judgement here.
    The first play was fun though.

Angela: I would add <b>Trickerion</b>. It's a punitive, heavy, worker placement Euro style game, which makes it pretty perfect. Too bad it's hard to buy, less interesting without the Dark Alley expansion.
</p>

<p>
Also would add <b>Millenium Blades</b>. It was so intense and involved so much setup the first time that I felt exhausted and didn't enjoy it. But in the months since, have been wanting to try it more and more. It is so thematic and unique.
