# Board Games for Date Nights

Not that Robbie has tried to impress me by arranging a fantabulous date night with amazing board games... but if he did, this is what I would suggest.

What makes a good date night board game?

- Not too competitive or punitive. It seems difficult to align perfectly on what level of competitiveness would be good, so I would err on the side of less competitive or less punitive.

- Small rules can't be too important. It's ok if the game is complicated and has some small rules that are hard to remember, but if these small rules are very important and you will do very poorly if you can't remember them all, it might not be the best game. Seems unfortunate if one person forgets something and has a terrible time.

- Shorter or Longer? Personal preference- would you rather play the same game a couple of times, or bond over a longer one? I tried to suggest some in both categories.

- Try not to involve too much background knowledge. If one of you loves Game of Thrones and the other just watches the TV show sometimes, maybe pass on that Game of Thrones trivia game. I maintain that knowing something about the Cold War helps in Twilight Struggle, Robbie disagrees (but probably because he knows more about the Cold War!)

- Involves some interaction. Not a game where it's easy to be two ships that pass in the night or games where you think of a strategy at the beginning and the play is mainly execution.


Top shorter games (game- tldr theme - comments):

- Patchwork- make a quilt
- Barenpark- make a zoo
- Azul- make a tile wall
- Photosynthesis- you're growing trees
- Codenames Duet - guessing game - worked ok with two players, I liked it!
- Cottage Garden - plant your garden - tile drafting with a more interesting way of drafting
- Unlock! - escape room as board game
- Kingdomino - make a kingdom of different terrains

Cute 2 Player Abstracts if you like Chess
- Santorini - whoever adds that final blue cap wins
- Hive - arrange your bugs
- Tak - Name of the Wind, Kvothe - though it's not that cute compared to Santorini

I want some longer games:
- Fog of Love - roleplay a relationship - if you are ok to be in character. Takes a long time to learn how to play.
- Baseball Highlights 2048 - baseball deckbuilder - I don't know anything about baseball, but it is still very fun! Good if one of you wants to share a hobby with the other.
- Networks - craft your tv series - the cards are really funny
- TIME Stories - multi-run time-travel - significantly longer than the others but quite fun, lots of discussion
- Near and Far - explore with your little team - I think it's better than Above and Below
- Dungeon Petz - raise wacky magical pets - hard to find but fun theme, a bit complicated though

Cooperative or Bust
- Pandemic Iberia or Pandemic Rising Tide - spanish flu or saving the netherlands from flooding - beautiful and fun pandemics
- Sentinels of the Multiverse - cooperative deckbuilder, you are superheroes
- Stuffed Fables - stuffed animals fighting nightmares - scaled back gloomhaven
- City of Kings - - more complicated than the others
- Spirit Island - - more complicated than the others
- TIME Stories - multi-run time-travel - significantly longer than the others but quite fun, lots of discussion

I'm a competitive person, how can I demolish my date?
- Twilight Struggle, Risk, or be like Robbie and try to secretly ambush me in Civ 5 while I thought we were just playing for fun
