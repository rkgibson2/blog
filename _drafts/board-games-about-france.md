# Board Games about France

Recently we seem to have arrived in Paris, and I've compiled a list of board games that are set in or related to France. A lot of them are quite difficult to find, but I wrote a quick review for the ones we've played and what about them seemed French.

Disclaimer: I rate games - - - to 0 to + + + and in general, am more harsh than Robbie. My favorite games are strategic punitive Euros or games with simple rules but a lot of strategy. I don't generally like war games or too much dice rolling.
