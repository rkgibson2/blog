# Cafes

Disclaimer: We like visiting board game cafes.
Many of these we have been lucky enough to visit as tourists.
Unfortunately, most of them we haven't been to enough times to provide a thorough review, so we have commented our quick thoughts below.
We enjoyed our time at all of these cafes!

Angela Reviews
[angela is critical, sorry. but all cafes get the highest rating possible, +++, because having these great places where we can play and try games and meet other people is the best and most important thing]

+++, Knight Moves, Somerville, MA, USA and Brookline, MA, USA (6, visited 2016, 2017):
Grouping the Somerville and Brookline locations.
Both locations are too small, though the table size is decent.
Game selection is alright, have a lot of games I like and their collection is quite updated.
Games don't have much organization though, so it can be hard to find a specific game and also the inside of the games don't have labeled baggies or anything like that.
At the Brookline location, twice I've been told in an unsolicited manner by some man that they are some board game expert and can teach me how to really play.
Thanks, dudes.
Food -- when we first went, they mostly had hotdogs and snacks and such.
The toasted hotdog bun is great.
I would prefer if the tea was looseleaf when you ordered a whole pot instead of a single tea bag in a pot of tea...

Games Played: **Splendor**, **Patchwork**, **Five Tribes**, **Pandemic: The Cure**, **Castles of Burgundy**, **Colt Express**, **Codenames**, **Carcassone**, **Agricola**, **Kingdomino**, **Tzolk'in**, **Betrayal at House on the Hill**, some others...

+++, Uncommons, New York City, NY, USA (1, visited 2016):
Location is small but they really try to pack everyone in--understandable, since it's prime Manhattan real estate.
Game selection is very large and diverse, really great, but they are stacked pretty high up so it can be hard to reach.
Not the cleanest, and food when we went was mostly grilled hotdogs, frozen food, etc. meh.

Games Played: **Jaipur**, **Castles of Burgundy**, **Isle of Skye**, **Caverna**, **Battleship** (Robbie cheated btw)

+++, Draughts, London, UK (1, visited 2016):
Location is a bit outside of touristy London but pretty straightforward to get there.
Place is beautiful, the brick inside and wood bar is so nice.
Food looked really good and they had a nice selection of things to order.
Board game selection was pretty good when we went, great organization as well.
One of the first board game cafes we ever went to.

Games Played: **Agricola**, **Treasure Hunter**, some others that were not recorded...

+++, Randolph Pub Ludique, many locations in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (2, visited 2017, 2018):
Robbie and I have been to separate locations.
Great selection of games, the people working there bring them to you.
Good selection of things to be sold.
Tried to buy **Azul**, which they said they had, but couldn't find... bit awkward.
Lots of great games and large selection!
Food was pretty good but fairly standard/expected bar-ish type fair.

Games Played: **Settlers of Catan**, **Blokus**, **Jenga**, **Carcassone**, **For Sale**, **Tsuro**, **BÃ¤renpark**

+++, Victory Point, Berkeley, CA, USA (visited 2016-2018): TODO

Games Played: Way too many to list (136, precisely).
Top 10 most played: **Schotten Totten**, **Kingdomino**, **Terraforming Mars**, **Magic Maze**, **Spirit Island**, **Sentinels of the Multiverse**, **Santorini**, **Caverna**, **Scythe**, **Gaia Project**.
Interesting call outs: **Fog of Love**, **Tales of the Arabian Nights**, **Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective**, **Time Stories**, **Yokohama**, **Root**, **Wendake**, **Firefly Adventures: Brigands and Browncoats**, **Thunderstone Advance: Tower of Ruin**

+++, Caffeinated Dragon Games, Wellington, NZ (1, visited 2017):
99% a game store, 1% a board game cafe.
Game selection you can play is very small, and I don't recall what food you order.

Games Played: N/A though did consider playing **Mice and Mystics**

+++, Counter Culture, Wellington, NZ (2, visited 2017):
We went soon after it opened, but it was pretty packed.
Area was small but the tables were spacious.
They had a section for NZ board game designers, which I liked.
Definitely when we went, seemed like they were still working on building their collection.
Some things were a bit awkward--the tokens for **Ora et Labora** for example were in a separate wooden box, but two people we asked didn't know where it was (buried behind some other games).
Food was really good!
Loved the dinner we had.
Prawns were tiny though.
Unfollowed them on Facebook, forgot why.

Games Played: **Dungeon Petz**, **Ora et Labora**, **Mystic Vale**, **Herbaceous**, **Shipwrights of the North Sea**

+++, Bastard Cafe, Copenhagen, Denmark (1, visited 2017):
Amazing place, really loved it.
Bar has amazing drink selection, including full gin bar.
Coffee is fantastic.
Food selection is unfortunately poor, though the stacked fries were good.
Board game selection is fantastic!
They have a separate room in the back of more heavy games, and they have a hugely diverse collection.
Saw on FB they ordered some games from Africa as well.
Also like their videos/posts from Essen.
Robbie hasn't been, sucks to be him.

Games Played: **Terraforming Mars**, **Sequence**, **Dead Man's Draw**

+++, Mox Boardinghouse, Seattle, WA, USA and Bellevue, WA, USA (2, visited 2018):
excellent selection of food and amazing amount of space.
I don't get how the restaurant works--they don't seem to try to turnover tables, so if you and your buddies rolled up with **Rising Sun** (true story), you could just sit there the entire time?
Board game selection was alright but not amazing.
I thought given the diversity of games they sold, they would have greater amounts available for demo.
Tempted to purchase **Fields of Arle**.

Games Played: **Champions of Midgard**, **Paperback**, **Grand Austria Hotel**, **Scoville**, **Legendary Encounters: Firefly**, **Grimm Forest**

+++, Meisia, Paris, France(1, visited 2018):
board game selection was good and quite large but awkward to access--the section downstairs was hard to see.
They say you should contact them ahead and they will pull games for you, but not sure if they keep their online list of games updated.
Selection of board games for sale was small but diverse.
Food--interesting but not that good, also quite messy to eat.
Their asian bun themed burgers--the bun needs to be toasted or it gets way too soggy.
The Meisia **Quadropolis** tiles--loved!

Games Played: **Dice Forge**, **Pandemic: Contagion**, **Topiary**, **Schotten Totten**

+++, Marche, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia (1, visited 2018):
Small board game selection but had a few new ones that I enjoyed.
Food was pretty good and quite fun, mostly Asian themed, also had some milk bubble tea smoothie type drinks.
The rice bowl--egg is great, the pork is too salty.
Seating wasn't super efficient.
It's like half a karaoke bar, so if you sit at the one table in the back it's a bit loud.
Really pretty decor inside.

Games Played: **Euphoria**, **Azul**, **Village**

+++, Queen of Spades, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia (1, visited 2018):
beautiful place.
Really gorgeous wood paneling and decor.
Food was perfectly Melbourne (avocado toast anyone?), excellent coffee and spritzers.
Bathroom involved going outside, not a favorite.
Board game selection was small and not great.
I don't think we could have played any very long games if we didn't decide to play Twilight Struggle again.

Games Played: **Twilight Struggle**, **Gloom**, **Codenames Duet**, **Timeline Challenge**, **Carcassone: South Seas**

+++ Board Game Republic, Denver, CO, USA (1, visited 2018):
Angela hasn't been to this one, so too bad for her.
I thought it was great.
The location wasn't the biggest, but it wasn't too crowded when we went.
Although we didn't play any heavy games, there was a good selection of them available.
The food was also good.
I had a delicious milkshake.
</p>

Games Played: **Timeline: Diversity**, **Timeline: American History**, **Magic Maze**, **Azul**


+++, Game Parlour, San Francicso, CA, USA (3, visited 2018):
great selection of games!
Nice organization as well, enforced by asking people to return games to the center table.
A lot of Kickstarter games, super fun and unique and many games that are quite hard to find.
Seating, even for 2, has enough space for a pretty large game.
Seats by the window get VERY warm when the sun shines in, but sitting in the sun is lovely.
Food--they had some spin on waffle sandwiches--I hate waffles and they got soggy way too quickly.
Also I was confused about the mechanics of consumption.
Is knife and fork the strategy?
Salad was good, mohiko chicken bites really good.
Soda seemed too expensive.
Loved the dice towers!

<div class="robbie">
<p>
I really liked the waffle sandwiches.
They were mochi waffles, so a bit chewy, but that was the best part!

Games Played: **Trickerion**, **Vinhos**, **City of Kings**, **Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization**, **Galaxy Trucker**, **Lewis and Clark**, **Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn**
